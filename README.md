## War Card Game Description
The deck is divided evenly, with each player getting 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them. Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck. If the cards are the same, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes the cards. If the cards are again the same value, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all cards, and so on.
